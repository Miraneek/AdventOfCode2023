## Introduction

Welcome to my project repository for Advent of Code! This repository contains my solutions and implementations of Advent of Code challenges for 2023. Advent of Code is an annual programming event with daily challenges leading up to Christmas.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **`/dayXX`**: Each challenge day has its own directory.
  - **`input.txt`**: The input files for a given prompt.
  - **`dayXX.java`**: Source code files containing the solution.
